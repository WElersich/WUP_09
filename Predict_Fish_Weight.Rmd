# Predicting Fish Weight


## Perch

```{r}
Perch <- filter(Fish, Species == "Perch") %>%
  select("Weight", "Length1", "Length2", "Length3", "Height", "Width")
```

### Best Models



### Best Two regressor model

```{r}
library(leaps)
regsubsets.out <-
    regsubsets(Weight ~ .,
               data = Perch,
               nbest = 1,       # 1 best model for each number of predictors
               nvmax = NULL,    # NULL for no limit on number of variables
               force.in = NULL, force.out = NULL,
               method = "exhaustive")

summary.out <- summary(regsubsets.out)
as.data.frame(summary.out$outmat)
library(car)
subsets(regsubsets.out,statistic="adjr2",legend="bottomright",main="Adjusted R^2")
```

The best model is the Two Regressor model predicts Weight by Height and Width, which gives the highest adjusted R-sqaured value.

```{R}
PerchModel <- lm(Weight~Height + Width, data = Perch)
summary.lm(PerchModel)
```

```{R}
PerchModel1 <- lm(Weight~Height + Width + Length2, data = Perch)
summary.lm(PerchModel1)
```

These two models, PerchModel and PerchModel1, confirm, through the residual standard errors and Adjusted R-squared values confirm that the above two regressor model is superior to the three regressor model.

## Bream

```{r}
Bream <- filter(Fish, Species == "Bream") %>%
  select("Weight", "Length1", "Length2", "Length3", "Height", "Width")
```
